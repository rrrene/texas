# Texas config file
# =================

# You can execute commands before and after the PDF is compiled,
# and alter the commands executed by Texas to compile and open the
# generated PDF:
#
# script:
#   before: "# this run before anything else"
#   compile: 'pdflatex -halt-on-error "<%= File.basename(build.master_file) %>"'
#   after: "# this is run after the pdf compilation"
#   open: 'evince "<%= build.dest_file %>"'
#

# The document hash is intended to store information relevant to your
# templates:
document:
  author: "Your Name"
  title: "Document Title"
#
# You can add anything you want here, like
#
# status: Draft
# 
# and then access it in your templates via
#
#   <%= document.status %>
#
